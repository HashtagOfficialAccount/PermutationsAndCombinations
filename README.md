# PermutationsAndCombinations
A simple python program that finds the permutations and combinations. In mathematics, combination and permutation are two different ways of grouping elements of a set into subsets. In a combination, the elements of the subset can be listed in any order. In a permutation, the elements of the subset are listed in a specific order.
